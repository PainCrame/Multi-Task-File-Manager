## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

My name is PainCram√©, I'm a student and a beginner programmer in C.  
This programme was an opportunity for me to challenge myself and complete my first project!  
I got the idea while sorting photos on an old USB stick,  and I thought to myself, ‚ÄòGood heavens, this is slow!‚Äô  
It would be really useful to have software to do it for me! And so here I am.


## üöÄ Usage

Open a terminal and run the command ```mtfm "C:\The_path_to_the_folder"```

```source.powershell
>>> mtfm "C:\Users\Hello\Downloads"
>>> Welcome to the Multi-Function File Manager!

	You are in the folder: C:\Users\Hello\Downloads
    (CTRL+C if you want to stop the program)

    Would you like to: DELETE FILES (0) or CLEAN UP THE FOLDER (1)  or SORT THE FOLDER (2) or EXTRACT ALL FILES (3) :
	
```
